Monte Carlo simulation is a data-driven approach to quantify risk, understand project risks and predict outcomes. It is best used to predict the likelihood of schedule and cost overruns, along to quantify risks to assess impacts better. The output of the Monte Carlo Simulation reveals the range of possible outcomes and their probability of occuring.
