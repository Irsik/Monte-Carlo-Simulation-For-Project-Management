## How to test sample notebooks using Jupyter Notebooks?

1. Download the notebooks source code after installing Jupyter on your computer. To be able to perform estimations, download full repositories with Monte Carlo Simulation and Linear Regression sample code.

2. Once the sample source code repository is downloaded to the local environment, proceed with the following command to start Jupyter notebooks locally:

```
jupyter notebook
```
3. Default browser will launch Jupyter Labs. Navigate to recently downloaded repository with notebooks. 
    Jupyter notebooks have ``` .ipynb ``` extension. Open the one you'd like to try and click ``` Run ``` for every cell to get the results. Most functions and calls are annotated and explain their role within the notebook. 

Jupyter Notebooks are unique in a way that after making every cell  ``` Run ``` , there can be expected an output.
