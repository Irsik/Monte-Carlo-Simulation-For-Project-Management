The Monte Carlo method uses probability distribution (the odds of occurrence of different possible events) to generate an array of potential outcomes to "simulate reality”.

The final project outcome rarely comes close to the estimate. It is after all an estimate, not a prediction. In other words, if you would do the same project thousands of times in parallel universes, you will have thousands of different outcomes.


It tells you two things:
* All of the possible events that could or will happen
* The probability of each possible outcome

### Pros/Cons
#### Pros:
* It is flexible and allows us to diversify risk assumptions

#### Cons:
* Complicated technique, we need to educate teams on how each of the three Monte Carlo Simulation methods work
* Strongly relies either on confidence level or throughput analysis

#

The Monte Carlo simulation uses both **deterministic** and **probabalistic** approaches to forecast the effort needed for a given project.  

**Deterministic** approach tries to calculate the outcome based on the parameters. 
* *For example: If the project is estimated for 3 months originally, what is the confidence level that it will actually be done within 3 engineering months?* 

**Probabalistic** approach attempts to quantify something by a probability distribution. 
* *For example: How much time this project will take based on the team's past performance or average velocity*

We expect Monte Carlo simulation to help us reduce the estimate’s error margin while applying its various methods throughout the project lifecycle.
