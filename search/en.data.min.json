Download the notebooks source code after installing Jupyter on your computer. To be able to perform estimations, download full repositories with Monte Carlo Simulation and Linear Regression sample code.\n  Once the sample source code repository is downloaded to the local environment, proceed with the following command to start Jupyter notebooks locally:\n  jupyter notebook Default browser will launch Jupyter Labs. Navigate to recently downloaded repository with notebooks. Jupyter notebooks have .ipynb extension. Open the one you\u0026rsquo;d like to try and click Run for every cell to get the results. Most functions and calls are annotated and explain their role within the notebook.  Jupyter Notebooks are unique in a way that after making every cell Run , there can be expected an output.\n"},{"id":9,"href":"/Monte_Carlo_and_Linear_Regression_For_PM/monte-carlo/","title":"Monte Carlo Simulation","parent":"","content":"    When To Use     Input     Output     Dice Roll Concept     Based on Confidence     Based on Historical Data     "},{"id":10,"href":"/Monte_Carlo_and_Linear_Regression_For_PM/Application/design-phase/","title":"Design Phase","parent":"Use Cases","content":""},{"id":11,"href":"/Monte_Carlo_and_Linear_Regression_For_PM/monte-carlo/output/","title":"Output","parent":"Monte Carlo Simulation","content":""},{"id":12,"href":"/Monte_Carlo_and_Linear_Regression_For_PM/linear-regression/input/","title":"Input","parent":"Linear Regression","content":""},{"id":13,"href":"/Monte_Carlo_and_Linear_Regression_For_PM/linear-regression/","title":"Linear Regression","parent":"","content":"    How to Use     When to Use     Input     Output     Single Regression     Multiple Regression     "},{"id":14,"href":"/Monte_Carlo_and_Linear_Regression_For_PM/Application/project-in-progress/","title":"Project in Progress","parent":"Use Cases","content":""},{"id":15,"href":"/Monte_Carlo_and_Linear_Regression_For_PM/Application/","title":"Use Cases","parent":"","content":"    Pre Scoping Phase     Scoping Phase     Design Phase     Project in Progress     "},{"id":16,"href":"/Monte_Carlo_and_Linear_Regression_For_PM/monte-carlo/dice-roll-concept/","title":"Dice Roll Concept","parent":"Monte Carlo Simulation","content":""},{"id":17,"href":"/Monte_Carlo_and_Linear_Regression_For_PM/linear-regression/output/","title":"Output","parent":"Linear Regression","content":""},{"id":18,"href":"/Monte_Carlo_and_Linear_Regression_For_PM/monte-carlo/based-on-confidence/","title":"Based on Confidence","parent":"Monte Carlo Simulation","content":""},{"id":19,"href":"/Monte_Carlo_and_Linear_Regression_For_PM/linear-regression/single-regression/","title":"Single Regression","parent":"Linear Regression","content":""},{"id":20,"href":"/Monte_Carlo_and_Linear_Regression_For_PM/monte-carlo/based-on-historical-data/","title":"Based on Historical Data","parent":"Monte Carlo Simulation","content":""},{"id":21,"href":"/Monte_Carlo_and_Linear_Regression_For_PM/linear-regression/multiple-regression/","title":"Multiple Regression","parent":"Linear Regression","content":""},{"id":22,"href":"/Monte_Carlo_and_Linear_Regression_For_PM/","title":"","parent":"","content":"##New Info\n"},{"id":23,"href":"/Monte_Carlo_and_Linear_Regression_For_PM/tags/","title":"Tags","parent":"","content":""}]
